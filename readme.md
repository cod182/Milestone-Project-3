# Milestone-Project-3

## 

## Project

The purpose of this site will be to allow users to add their review for a recently played game. If the game does not exist in the archive, a user would be able to add the game to the archive. Users would also be able to search for a game to read reviews on it. A link will be available to users to purchase the game from an affiliate site.

# Showcase

A deployed link to the site can be found [here]()
